Housing Pricing Dataset Analysis
This repository contains code to analyze a housing pricing dataset using Linear Regression in Python.

Dataset
The dataset contains features related to housing properties and their corresponding prices.

Analysis
The analysis script performs the following steps:

Loads the dataset using pandas.
Preprocesses the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if any).
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains a Linear Regression model on the training data.
Evaluates the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
The evaluation results are printed to the console.

Results
The analysis provides insights into the accuracy and precision of the Linear Regression model in predicting housing prices based on the dataset.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse_value}
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): {mae_value}
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): {rmse_value}

Contribution
Contributions to improve the analysis or add new features are welcome. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
